title: "FB6: Fuzzing with Grammar"
---

SUMMARY OF CONTENT:

"Fuzzing with Grammar" is a way to utilize fuzzing with a total called Grammars. Grammars are a programming tool which are used to generate non-numerical or alphabetical characters. This can be utilized for the fuzzing algorithm to generate multiple different algorithms for more efficient and effective fuzzing.


PERSONAL REFLECTION:

Fuzzing already serves an important purpose in our Chasten tool as it is integrated into the tool. Grammars would be a helpful tool, should they be included as well and integrated into the fuzzing tool.


RELEVANT ACTION ITEMS:

Fuzzing with grammars would enable our Chasten tool to become more efficient and productive. It would enable us to process more inputs as well as creating a tool which runs and operates faster.
